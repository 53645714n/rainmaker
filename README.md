Remote control and timer for springkler system.
The pump for the sprinkler system is a DAB ESC 4 T, which has a s/w connection for turning on and off the pump which I will be switching with a relais connected to a Raspberry Pi.

## Components
- 4 channel 433Mhz RF remote with receiver
- Raspberry Pi B+ (yeah, the oldie)
- 5V relais 1-channel high-active
- Green and red buttons with switchable LED

## The concept
### Remote
Because it is hard to find the correct spot for the sprinkler at once, the farmer spends a lot of time walking
